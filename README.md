# gmail-notifications

This is a gmail notifications tool, in this case I'm using it to send me my ngixn status.

Make sure to have installed:

 - `sendmail`: In linux try with sudo apt-get install sendmail
 - `php: >=7.1 <8.1`: Make sure to have the propper version
 - `composer`: Follow the instructions in https://getcomposer.org/download/

For this I'm using the `nette/mail` package.
